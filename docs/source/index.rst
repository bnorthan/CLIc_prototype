CLIc Documentation
******************

CLIc is a C++ library for image processing on the GPU. It serves as a backend for the clEsperanto project. The library primarily relies on OpenCL (and other GPU languages) for computation but is designed to have other backend in the future.
This documentation will focus on the library design and code.
