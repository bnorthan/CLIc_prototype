Versioning
----------

The versioning of this project is based on the `Semantic Versioning Specification <http://semver.org/>`__.

Semantic Versions are in the format: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``.

   - :bug and typo fix: increase the patch version
   - :new functionality in a non-breaking way: increase the minor version (and reset patch to 0)
   - :breaking changes: increase the major version (and reset the patch and minor version to 0).

The project version is managed directly in the github release page.

.. note::

   We are currently in a alpha stage, ``MAJOR`` is kept to 0 until we reach a stable version.
