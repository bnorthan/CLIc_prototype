CLIc is a **prototype** backend library for [CLesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto) - a multi-language framework for GPU-accelerated image processing. It uses the [OpenCL kernels](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij-opencl-kernels/tree/clesperanto_kernels) originally developped for [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io/). It currently focussed on running with [OpenCL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP).

The library is used for various user-oriented API libraries:
- :snake: [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto)
- :coffee: [clesperantoj](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clesperantoj_prototype)
- Fiji plugin - [clij3](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij3)

# __Usage example__

```c++
#include "clesperanto.h"  // CLIc include

int main( int argc, char** argv)
{
    // Initialisation of clEsperanto with default device
    cle::BackendManager::getInstance().setBackend();
    auto device = cle::BackendManager::getInstance().getBackend().getDevice("", "all");

    // host vector to hold input and output
    std::vector<float> input (width * height * depth);
    std::vector<float> output (input.size());

    /*
     * ... fill input with data to process
     */

    // push data from host to device
    auto gpu_src = cle::Push<float>(input.data(), width, height, depth, device);
    // apply filter with parameters
    auto gpu_dst = cle::tier1::AddImageAndScalar(device, gpu_src, nullptr, 10);
    // pull output from device to host
    cle::Pull<float>(gpu_dst, output.data());

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
See more complete example on usage by looking at the kernels [tests](./tests/).

# __Contributing__
Contributions are very welcome. Before spending effort on coding and filing a pull-request, please get in touch with us, [file an issue](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc/issues), and let's discuss your potential contribution.
More information on how to add new kernels to the library can be found in the [documentation](https://clesperanto.github.io/CLIc/master/en/doc/functions.html).

# __Feedback welcome!__
clEsperanto is developed in the open because we believe in the [open source community](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/community_guidelines).
