CLIc is a **prototype** backend library for [CLesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto) - a multi-language framework for GPU-accelerated image processing. It uses the [OpenCL kernels](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij-opencl-kernels/tree/development/src/main/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clij/kernels) from [CLIJ](https://clij.github.io/)

It is a preliminary projet and mainly focussed on running a kernel using the [OpenCL C++ API from Khronos](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-CLHPP).

# __Usage example__

```c++
#include "clesperanto.h"  // CLIc include

int main( int argc, char** argv)
{
    // Initialisation of clEsperanto with default device
    cle::BackendManager::getInstance().setBackend();
    auto device = cle::BackendManager::getInstance().getBackend().getDevice("", "all");

    // host vector to hold input and output
    std::vector<float> input (width * height * depth); 
    std::vector<float> output (input.size()); 

    /*
     * ... fill input with data to process  
     */

    // push data from host to device
    auto gpu_src = cle::Push<float>(input.data(), width, height, depth, device);
    // apply filter with parameters
    auto gpu_dst = cle::tier1::AddImageAndScalar(device, gpu_src, nullptr, 10);
    // pull output from device to host
    cle::Pull<float>(gpu_dst, output.data()); 

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
See more complete example on usage by looking at the kernels [tests](./tests/).

# __Installation__

## Requirements

CLIc rely on OpenCL language for parallelisation and CMake for configuration and build.  
Follow the [installation guide](./docs/guidelines.md) for helps on compilation and installation. 

## Quick install

Clone the repository and update the submodules
```
git clone git@github.com:clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype.git
cd CLIc_prototype
```

Create a build folder and configure cmake to generate the adapted makefile.
Then compile the library and install it at specified location on your system.
```
cmake -S . -B ./build -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation/folder
cmake --build ./build --parallel 10 --target install
```

You can modify installation location using `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installation/folder`. If not specify, the default location is `/usr/local`.

CLIc can be uninstall by running the following command
```
cmake --build ./build --target uninstall
```

## Kernels
CLIc filters rely on the clEsperanto branch of [CLIj OpenCL kernels](https://github.com/clEsperanto/clij-opencl-kernels). They are managed as a submodule of this repository.

# __Contributing__
Contributions are very welcome. Before spending effort on coding and filing a pull-request, please get in touch with us, [file an issue](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype/issues), and let's discuss your potential contribution. 
More information on how to add new kernels to the library can be found in the [documentation](./docs/add_new_kernel/add_new_kernel.md).

# __Feedback welcome!__
clEsperanto is developed in the open because we believe in the [open source community](https://clij.github.io/clij2-docs/community_guidelines). 
Feel free to drop feedback as [github issue](https://github.com/clEsperanto/CLIc_prototype/issues) or via [image.sc](https://image.sc).  
And if you liked our work, star the repository, share it with your friends, and use it to make cool stuff!
